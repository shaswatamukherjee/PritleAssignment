    <p><b>Question:</b> How do you prefer to implement event handling using pure JavaScript?
        What Js-Frameworks solutions have you tried on previous/current positions? Show some simple examples.</p>
    <p><b>Answer</b></p>
    <p>
        I always prefer binding event with the controls i.e. binding event with a button or textbox instead of separately adding event
        while scripting.<br>
        I have mainly worked on TIBCO General Interface where binding events were done using the plug and play mechanism where its the
        same way as binding event to the control.
        Same way is done in Angular JS as well.<br>
        Another way which I prefer using CSS. Examples of both the ways are shown below: <br>
        1. Event binding in HTML to the control. When you click on the submit button and alert is triggered.:<br>
        <pre>&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" onclick="alert('Hello World')"&gt;</pre>
        2. Adding a hover to any text and that event is handled in the CSS file.<br>
        <pre>&lt;label class="someClass"&gt;My name is Shaswata.&lt;/label&gt;</pre>
        Under css we write as
        <pre>.someClass {color:#333333;} <br>.someClass:hover {color:#ff0000;} <br></pre>
        So when someone hovers onto the text the colour changes to red and when mouse is moved out then it burns black.
