    <p><b>Question:</b> Give explanations on how JavaScript is being run in browsers. How to achieve multithreading in code?</p>
    <p><b>Answer</b></p>
    <p>
        As far as my knowledge says, Javascript always runs in a single thread mode because at browser the JS interpreter is single threaded
        and moreover sometimes we fake the browser by using async calls like setTimeout, which creates a separate Execution stack outside of the global
        execution stack where the synchronous js lines of code are executed. This async can be used to create a separate thread of any piece of code.
