    <p><b>Question:</b> Explain inheritance in JavaScript. What are the approaches? Mention pros and cons.</p>
    <p><b>Answer</b></p>
    <p>Inheritance in javascript logically is same as in other OOP. The concept means that some of the properties are inherited from its super, by referencing the property with a base of the super.
    In Javascript the concept of inheritance associated with only one construct which is Js objects. Using objects whatever you extract is termed as inheritance.
    I will share two examples which shall cover this:<br>
    <pre>
    var obj = {
        name: "Shaswata Mukherjee",
        address: {
            place: "Stromboli",
            housenr: "1",
            city: "Amstelveen",
            zip: "1186CH"
        },
        getAddress: function() {
            return this.address.place + ' ' + this.address.housenr + ',' + this.address.city + ', ' + this.address.zip;<br>
        }
    }
    </pre>
    In the above snippet, you would find an object containing some properties, a method and an important term property chaining or prototype chaining.
    This is an important concept which explains how from the object "obj" we can chain the property to get the value. This is inheritance,
        <br>
    if we try to access the method "getAddress" using:<br>
    obj.getAddress() which is also a way of achieving inheritance, then the following things happen:<br>
    using this.address.place -> this is the reference to the object obj and then using property chain<br>
        obj > address > place we get "Stromboli". This is how we implement inheritance.<br>
        <br>
    Pros:
        <ol>
            <li>According to me using a singleton makes the code more modularised. All variables and related methods are maintained under one head.</li>
            <li>It reduces an overhead of declaring such properties</li>
            <li>Same property names i.e variable and method names can be used over and over again as the encapsulating object is unique.</li>
        </ol>
    Cons:
        <ol>
            <li>Sometimes referenced variable are a little difficult to maintain. For a small project, inheritance increases overhead.</li>
        </ol>

    </p>
